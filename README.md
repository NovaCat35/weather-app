## Challenges
While fetching API requests, I found myself in a bind with some function still executing even though promises are still being waited on. This cause issues with input blank and errors that would cause my reset functions and tracking variables to record the error issues instead of immediately exiting out like I planned. Eventually, I decided to account for this my placement of certain variables to prevent execution from reaching the code and specifying a better catch block to handle the errors. I learn more about the concept of promises and fetching information through these challenges.
