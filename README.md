## Challenges
While fetching API requests, I found myself in a bind with how I structure try-catch blocks around promises and deal with fetch and input errors. This would lead to a number of issues where some functions are being executed even when there's an error instead of being caught. From these challenges, trials, and errors, going forward I would be a bit more aware of implementing for mistakes and some misconceptions of try-catch in dealing with fetch errors.
