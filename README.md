## Challenges
While fetching API requests, I found myself in a bind with the way I structure try-catch blocks around promises and dealing with fetch errors and input errors. This would lead to a number of issues where some functions are being executed even when there's error instead of being catch. From these challenges, trials, and errors, going forward I would be a bit more aware of implementing for errors and some misconceptions of try-catch in dealing with fetch errors.
